locations. This app is designed for beer enthusiasts that enjoy finding new venues to explore!

### Features (Proposed)

2. Users can click on a pin of a location and read user reviews
3. Users can create new reviews for a new/existing location
4. A list of the top reviewed locations with various filter to search with

## Prototype 2

For the second prototype we reworked the Add Review page so that the user can now 
enter all info for a review. Data entered within the form will be taken and used to 
create a JSON file, where all the review data will be stored. The app also now has a launch 
screen and icon, along with themed UI.

## Final Deliverable

The app is now fully functional. Test data is used to give the user two default places 
when they open the app for the first time. The user is able to use the form and submit a 
review. The review will be saved to their review page and the marker for it will be added 
to the map. If the user clicks a review it will show them the information that they entered.
